# PassHub Getting Started

Your user account is created automatically when you first login. You do not need to _register_ in PassHub.

### Scan to Sign-In (Desktop)

On a desktop, login to PassHub by scanning the QR code with the **WWPass Key** app on your smartphone.

### Touch to Sign-In (Mobile)

When opening PassHub in a smartphone browser, just tap the "Login with WWPass" button to sign-in with the local WWPass Key app. Alternatively, you may switch to the QR-code screen to login with a different mobile WWPass Key.

NOTE: To use PassHub.net, you need to install the **WWPass Key** app.

## WWPass Key App

- Get **WWPass Key** app on the AppStore or Google Play.
- Launch the app and follow instructions to personalize your WWPass Key.

  _Please write down and remember your WWPass PIN: it cannot be reset!_

- We recommend you follow the Key backup procedure. It is bound to your email address, and allows you to transfer the app to another device if your phone is lost or stolen, or if you upgrade to a new one.


## PassHub and WWPass Key

**PassHub.net** is a cloud-based password manager or a secure vault, while **WWPass Key** app is a secure authentication solution that eliminates the need for usernames and passwords.

You can think of the WWPass Key App as a key to access the PassHub data. For more information, see this explanation video: [PassHub.net and WWPass Key app: A vault and a key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hue3tTY26Ek)
